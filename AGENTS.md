> See [README.md](README.md) for project overview and architecture diagram.

Always ask for clarity if any instruction is not clear or new information is needed.

## Documentation

Project-wide docs in `docs/` follow the Diátaxis framework:

- `tutorials/` - Learning-oriented guides for new users
- `how-to/` - Task-oriented guides for specific goals
- `reference/` - Information-oriented lookup material
- `explanation/` - Understanding-oriented conceptual docs
- `decisions/` - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Documentation should be written in markdown that follows the linting standards

### Diagrams

Use Mermaid for all diagrams and flowcharts in documentation:

Mermaid is preferred because it:

- Renders natively in GitHub and VS Code
- Is version-controlled as text
- Requires no external tools to view or edit
